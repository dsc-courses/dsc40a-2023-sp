Homework 2 is now posted. As before, I've provided a LaTeX template through Overleaf; click the üçÉ emoji next to the homework to access it. Follow [these instructions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Copying_a_project#Making_a_copy_of_a_project) to make a copy of the template, and then add your solutions. Typing your solutions in LaTeX is optional, but it's good to learn how to do!
