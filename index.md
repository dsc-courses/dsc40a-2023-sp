The quarter is almost over and we'd like your feedback.  If at least 85% of the class fills out both the [End of Quarter Survey](https://forms.gle/RLSFGKLVsmwtftncA) and [SETs (Student Evaluations of Teaching)](https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/Modules/Evals), we will add 0.5% of extra credit to everyone's overall grade. The deadline to complete both surveys is **Saturday, June 10 at 9AM**.
