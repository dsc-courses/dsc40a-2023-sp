Hi everyone! My name is Lauren and I am a second-year Data Science and Joint Math Econ major. This is my second time tutoring a DSC course and first time tutoring DSC 40A. During my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, and trying out new sports. I look forward to working with you all this quarter! üòÅ
