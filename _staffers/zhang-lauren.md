Hi everyone! My name is Lauren and I am a second-year Data Science and Joint Math Econ major. I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, and trying out new sports during my free time. I want to be a tutor for DSC 10 because this is a fun course that introduced me to data science and inspired me to have data science as my second major. I look forward to meeting you all!
