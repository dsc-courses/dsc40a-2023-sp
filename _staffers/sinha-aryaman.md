Hey everyone! I am a Senior from Delhi, India majoring in Data Science. This will be my 5th time tutoring 40A which is my favorite class at UCSD and I hope you feel the same way by the end of the quarter. Outside the classroom, I am an avid sports fan - particularly Tennis, Cricket and Chess(Yes, Chess is a sport!). I enjoy using Data as a tool to develop strategies in sport and in other aspects of daily life, I look forward to helping equip you all with the skills to do the same.
