Hey everyone! Iâ€™m Harshi, a 3rd year majoring in Bioinformatics and minoring in Data Science. I was born and went to high school in the Bay Area, but lived in India from the ages of 6 to 14. I am excited to be a tutor for DSC 40A, since this course, as its title suggests, lays the foundation for more complex Data Science concepts. In my free time I read, play the violin, and due to my upbringing, love learning new languages.
