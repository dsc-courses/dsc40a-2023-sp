Hey everyone, my name is Selim and I'm very excited to tutor DSC 10 this quarter. I was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt and I'm still exploring San Diego so feel free to share your favorite hangout spots with me. I'm a 4th year Math-Econ major and a Data Science minor and I love tutoring DSC 10 because it's the class that made me decide to add my minor and hopefully continue in the data science field. I'm currently trying (and failing) to teach myself guitar so I can play 2006 Arctic Monkeys songs.
