Hi, I'm Selim and I'm from Cairo, Egypt. I'm in my last quarter at UCSD and im graduating with a major in Math-Econ and a minor in Data Science and if all goes well, my next step would be to get my masters in data science. I like DSC40A because it has a lot of probability concepts that I find really fun and use everyday, and i will absolutely go down probability rabbit holes in my head when im bored. I'm also part of the League esports team at UCSD (we're currently in playoffs, ask me more about it in office hours!)
