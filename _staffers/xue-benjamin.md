Hello everyone! My name is Ben, and I am a 3rd year Data Science major from Houston, Texas. This is my first time tutoring, so I am very excited to help everyone learn and enjoy everything taught in this class. DSC 40A was definitely my favorite data science course here, and you will learn a lot about the fundamentals of machine learning and probability. In my free time, I like to play basketball, watch football, and go on hikes around San Diego.
