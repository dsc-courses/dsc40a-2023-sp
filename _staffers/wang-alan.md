Hello everyone! My name is Zelong, or you can call me Alan. I'm from China and currently a junior double majoring in Data Science and Math-Econ. I took DSC 40A last year, and it truly piqued my interest in this fascinating field. The ideas and intuitions behind the concepts you'll learn in this course serve as crucial building blocks for more complex models in the future.

In my free time, I enjoy hitting up Rimac for a workout and unwinding with some video games. If you're curious to learn more about me, feel free to check out my [personal website](https://zew013.github.io). I'm always happy to chat, so don't hesitate to reach out! Looking forward to working with you all. ðŸ˜Š
