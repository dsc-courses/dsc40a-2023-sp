Hi! My name is Dylan and I'm a first-year master's student studying data science. I got my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at the University of Washington up in Seattle (where I grew up)! I train and compete in mixed martial arts, but when I have the chance I like to get outdoors and take pictures. I look forward to seeing you all this quarter, feel welcome to stop by office hours to say hi!
