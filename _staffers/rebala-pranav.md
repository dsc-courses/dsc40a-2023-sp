Hello! My name is Pranav and I am a second year data science student at UCSD coming from San Ramon, CA. I am excited to TA for DSC 40A because the concepts were the most interesting to me out of all the classes here. Outside of classes I love to listen to music, eat good food, and watch TV. I hope to get to know everyone in the class this quarter!
