Hi everyone! I'm Pallavi, and I am a second-year Data Science major with a minor in Cognitive Science. I am originally from Orange County and enjoy baking, reading, making art with markers or paint, and binge watching TV shows in my free time. Feel free to reach out with any questions and I am looking forward to meeting and working with you all!
