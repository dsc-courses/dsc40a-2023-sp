Hello, I’m Janine and I am excited to be teaching DSC 10 this quarter! I’m originally from New Jersey but I moved to San Diego over ten years ago for grad school at UCSD 🔱, where I studied combinatorics in the Math department. Since then, I've taught courses in Computer Science, Math, and Data Science. Outside of teaching, I love playing board games, crafting, and baking epic desserts! 🧁
