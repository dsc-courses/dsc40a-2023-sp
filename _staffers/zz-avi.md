Hi there! My name is Avi and it's my first quarter as the official DSC 40A course mascot. Avocados have been a part of this class for several years, and I am so excited to finally be able to represent these beloved fruits as a member of the course staff. Outside of class, you'll find me eating spicy food and hanging outside enjoying the beautiful SoCal weather!
