# Calendar ðŸ“…

This calendar contains information on course meetings and office hours (OH). All office hours will be held in-person on the second floor of the east wing of the San Diego Supercomputer Center ([map](https://g.page/SDSC_UCSanDiego?share)). Enter SDSC from the main entrance on Hopkins Drive, take the elevator up to the second floor, turn left at the kitchen, and meet in the common area.
